# 2FA-WSC
A WoltLab Suite Plugin for the version 3.0.X developed by the Dev-Tek.de development forum.

## Explanation
This plugin enables Two-Factor-Authentication (2FA) on WoltLab Suite Forums with the version 3.0.X. 2FA is an advanced security precaution on user logins. 

If the user activates 2FA in his settings, a security code is required on every login. The user gets the code from an 2FA client application. The server then validates the code and lets the user log in.
